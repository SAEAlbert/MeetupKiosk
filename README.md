Meetup.com Kiosk using the Python API

For the Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE) Expo local LA Meetup booth, I put together a website that will cycle through the local Meetups that I am a member of. http://meetupkiosk.appspot.com/ displays the most basic data for now and a QR code for people to sign up. I plan on setting up a Raspberry Pi and a monitor at the booth. Does someone want to help me improve this site? It's written in Python and is running on Google App Engine and is using the Meetup.com v2 API. The app using my API key to access the Meetup.com API.
