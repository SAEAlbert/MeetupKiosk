MeetupKiosk
===========

Meetup.com Kiosk using the Python API running on Google App Engine. 

For the Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE) Expo local LA Meetup booth, I put together a website that will cycle through the local Meetups that I am a member of. http://meetupkiosk.appspot.com/ displays the most basic data for now and a QR code for people to sign up. I plan on setting up a Raspberry Pi and a monitor at the booth. 

Does someone want to help me improve this site? The app using my API key to access the Meetup.com API.
